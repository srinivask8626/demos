HTML5 introduced several semantic elements to provide more meaning and structure to web documents, aiding accessibility, search engine optimization, and readability. Some of the key semantic elements include:

1. `<header>`: Used to define introductory content typically placed at the top of a section or webpage, such as a logo, navigation menu, or heading.

2. `<nav>`: Represents a section of navigation links.

3. `<main>`: Signifies the main content of a document. It should not be nested within `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, or `<nav>` elements.

4. `<article>`: Defines independent, self-contained content that can be reused or syndicated. Examples include blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.

5. `<section>`: Groups related content together. It's often used to divide a page into thematic areas.

6. `<aside>`: Represents content related to the primary content but not necessarily essential to understand it. Examples include sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.

7. `<footer>`: Contains information about its containing element, such as authorship, copyright information, or links to related documents.

8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: Used together to represent images or illustrations and their captions, respectively.

Using these semantic elements appropriately can improve the structure and accessibility of your HTML documents.
